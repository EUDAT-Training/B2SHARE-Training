# Communities
B2SHARE places records in community-specific collections. A user can only retrieve information about existing, already registered communities. To register new communities and define community-specific metadata schemas please refer to [dedicated](#registering-new-communities) section. This guide covers:

- Retrieval a list of all available communities
- Retrieval of community specific information
- Retrieval of a community's metadata schema

### Setup your connection
Please make sure your machine has been properly set up to use Python and required packages. Follow [this](A_Setup_and_install.md) guide in order to do so.

This guide assumes you have successfully registered your account on the [B2SHARE website](https://trng-b2share.eudat.eu) using your institutional credentials or social ID through B2ACCESS. In addition, the loading of the token, importing Python packages and checking request responses will not be covered here.
