# Getting you API token
This guide will make sure you have an API token which is required to access the B2SHARE service programmatically.

## Setup your machine and connection
Please make sure your machine has been properly setup to use Python and required packages. Follow [this](A_Setup_and_install.md) guide in order to do so.

## Account registration
This guide assumes you have successfully registered your account on B2SHARE using your institutional credentials through B2ACCESS.

## The account page
Go to the [B2SHARE website](https://b2share.eudat.eu). After logging in, navigate to your [account page](https://b2share.eudat.eu/youraccount/display) by clicking on your name on the home page of B2SHARE.

Click on the wrench next to 'Account' to go to your [profile settings page](https://b2share.eudat.eu/account/settings/profile). Select the bottom option in the left menu to go to the application and token [settings page](https://b2share.eudat.eu/account/settings/applications).
